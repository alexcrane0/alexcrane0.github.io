I am a PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of Utah, where I am advised by
[Dr. Blair D. Sullivan](https://sullivan.cs.utah.edu). I study algorithms on (hyper)graphs, and
my research focuses on developing practical methods for editing these structures to optimize some
characteristic of the network, e.g. promoting information flow, or to mine information, e.g. clustering.
Usually I approach problems from the perspective of parameterized
complexity, and I am especially interested in using techniques from this area to develop (hyper)graph
algorithms with relaxed objectives, e.g. clustering with overlap, or with added constraints, e.g.
notions of algorithmic fairness. Before becoming a grad student I was a software engineer, and 
in my free time I enjoy the numerous skiing, hiking, and climbing opportunities in the Wasatch
mountains of northern Utah.
